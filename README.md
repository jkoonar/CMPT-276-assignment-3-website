# CMPT-276-assignment-3-website
website for assignment 3

Project Overview: This website provides details on three types of guitars. This info is meant for people who are interested in purchasing
a guitar, and that do not have much knowledge on the instrument. The three types of guitar covered will be Gibson guitars, Fender guitars, and
an acoustic guitar brand. Links to the websites of these brands will be provided to the user so that they can obtain more information.

Tech Stack used: I used a combination of HTML and CSS for the development of my website. These were all platforms that I was familiar
with so I opted to use them instead of other options. They also provide all the needed functionality that my website was aiming for. Git was
used for version control with github being the focal point for repo management. For deployment I opted for Github pages for ease of use as well as
for achieving the assignment requirements.

License: I used the Apache License because I want to allow a good amount of flexibilty in terms of permitting code to be used externally. But I 
also like the added copyright protection it has over MIT for example.
