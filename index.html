        <h2>Gibson Stratocaster</h2>
        <p>These guitars often have a solid body. They are shorter in length relative to Fender telecasters.
          They often have humbucker pickups, which in turn generate a warmer and thicker guitar tone. These 
          guitars are great if you're interested in playing metal, rock, and the blues.

        <h2>Yamaha acoustic</h2>
        <p>A very popular acoustic guitar. Is a cheaper alternative to an electric guitar.
          The downside is learning to play with thicker stringers which can be a challenge.
          These come in various styles and yamaha acoustics have different tonewoods like 
          spruce, mahogany, and rosewood. These in turn generate different tones.
